Title: Sensitivity Analysis Informed by a Test for Bias
Version: 1.0.7
Author: Paul R Rosenbaum
Maintainer: Paul R Rosenbaum <rosenbaum@wharton.upenn.edu>
Description: After testing for biased treatment assignment in an observational study using an unaffected outcome, the sensitivity analysis is constrained to be compatible with that test.  The package uses the optimization software gurobi obtainable from <https://www.gurobi.com/>, together with its associated R package, also called gurobi; see: <https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/7.0/refman/installing_the_r_package.html>.  The method is a substantial computational and practical enhancement of a concept introduced in Rosenbaum (1992) Detecting bias with confidence in observational studies Biometrika, 79(2), 367-374  <doi:10.1093/biomet/79.2.367>.
